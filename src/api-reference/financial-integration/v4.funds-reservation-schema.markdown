# <a name="scallocationaccountresolverkey"></a>Allocation Account Resolver Key

## Request Allocation Account Resolver Key

1.  Concur level configurations of the request fields involved in
    resolving the allocation related cost centre should be setup. It
    should mimic the configurations at the Financial System
2.  In the order of the configuration, populate the values into a list
    (after converting to lower case)
3.  Create Type 5 UUID based on the string created by appending the list
    items with a separator (`|| `- Two consecutive pipes).Use the
    companyUUID as the UUID namespace

## Report Allocation Account Resolver Key

1.  Concur level configurations of the report fields involved in
    resolving the allocation related cost centre should be setup. It
    should mimic the configurations at the Financial System
2.  In the order of the configuration, populate the values into a list
    (after converting to lower case)
3.  Create Type 5 UUID based on the string created by appending the list
    items with a separator (`|| `- Two consecutive pipes). Use the
    company UUID namespace as the UUID namespace

# Allocation Linking

Since the fields that resolve to a cost centre should be the same for
both request and expense allocations, the
`allocationAccountResolverKey`should be the same for the allocations.
This key can be used to match allocations between entries that are
linked i.e. the matching should be done only for allocations of the
expense entries, that have a linked request entry.

The scope of the key is limited to the entry holding the allocations.
